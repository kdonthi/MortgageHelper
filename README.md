# MortgageHelper

## Introduction
This is a website I built using Node.js, MongoDB, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. After the tiles load, you should see data about each person in each tile. If you hover over a tile, you can see information about their financials and whether they currently qualify for a mortgage.

There is also a link to charts on the statistics hyperlink on the front page.
